Project: Touchstone Plotter. This code doesn't require MATLAB's RF toolbox to read data from a touchstone file and the user can have a plot of the s-parameters of their convenience (real imaginary or dB) using a GUI. The user can also specify certain i and j indices to have a specialized plot. (Warnig: it might give troubles for high number ports like s40p and above)
